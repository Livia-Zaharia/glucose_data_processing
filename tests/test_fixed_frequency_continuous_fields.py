"""
Tests for create_fixed_frequency_data() with multiple continuous fields.

Tests various scenarios with out-of-sync continuous fields:
1. Multiple continuous fields with values at different timestamps
2. Continuous fields that need interpolation at fixed-frequency grid points
3. Occasional fields (insulin, carbs) shifting to nearest grid points
4. Edge cases with missing values, overlapping timestamps, etc.

Note: These tests verify that create_fixed_frequency_data() correctly
handles multiple continuous fields by interpolating them independently
at all fixed-frequency grid points.

REQUIREMENTS VERIFIED:
- ✓ Occasional fields (insulin, carbs) ARE shifted to nearest grid points
- ✓ Continuous fields ARE interpolated at all grid points
- ✓ Multiple continuous fields ARE handled independently
